I want to make a Chess game in C++ and you can't tell me not to


Classes:

  Game
  
  Board
    [8*8} Matrix - This shouldnt be hard, I just need to figure out how to check for legal/illigal moves
    
  Piece
  
    [White/Black]Pawn[1-8]
      Moves - [][]
      
    [White/Black]Rook[1-2]
      Moves
      
    [White/Black]Knight[1-2]
      Moves
      
    [White/Black]Bishop[1-2]
      Moves
      
    [White/Black]Queen
      Moves
      
    [White/Black]King
      Moves

First step is to get the logic of a chess game down. 
  just a 8*8 matrix that holds the locations of each piece, and the logic system for how a chess game should proceed as well as legal/illegal moves.

Second step will be to attach some form of graphics so as to better understand what is happening.

Last will be finding a way to allow setting one or both players to be controled by the computer.

icing on the cake would be multiplayer across devices, but that is a whole different level
